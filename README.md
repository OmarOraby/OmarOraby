👋 Hi, I’m Omar, a passionate back-end Java developer specializing in microservices within large cloud environments. My journey in technology began during high school in Graz, where I developed an interest in robotics and participated in competitions, igniting my passion for Informatics.

👀 I started self-learning Java and Python at the end of 2020, which led me to pursue a dual Bachelor of Science in Engineering in Business Software Development at FH CAMPUS 02 and TU Graz. Over the years, I have focused on Java development using the Spring Framework, including Spring Boot, Spring Data, Spring Security, and Spring Cloud.

🌱 Currently, I’m working as Java Backend Dev. My daily tasks are developing and deploying microservices. I use Docker for containerization, WebFlux for reactive programming, and Kafka for asynchronous communication. My hands-on experience includes working on end-to-end IoT security applications and cloud integration projects. I also have experience with integration tests and working with PostgreSQL and other relational databases.

💬 I am fluent in Arabic, German, and English, allowing me to thrive in diverse and multicultural environments. In addition to my professional interests, I enjoy sailing and photography, which provide a creative outlet and help maintain a balanced lifestyle.

💞️ I’m eager to collaborate on innovative projects in Java back-end development and IT security. I am always seeking new challenges to expand my knowledge and contribute to cutting-edge solutions. Let’s connect and explore opportunities to work together!
